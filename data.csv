The mouse has been tenpemental from day one (yes I have changed the battery) and in the end I've reverted to using a wired mouse again. But over time the keyboard is now typing wrong characters and even taking me to different websites when I'm in the middle of the form.

"","","LLCoolJSmith","Vry dsaintng exrinceas prne o signal drop ot UPDATE: The above was written using my Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard, the below was written at work using a wired keyboard (a Lenovo if you’re really interested). I always look at negative reviews such as the one I’m about to give as being the irate ramblings of someone who probably isn’t using the item properly or who has unrealistic expectations of it. This keyboard and mouse set has 1,397 five star reviews at time of writing, it obviously works well for a lot of people and chances are it’ll work just fine for you. However, in my experience it is incredibly poor, disappointing so. I really hoped this would be a decent replacement for a stock wireless keyboard and mouse I got bundled with a PC many, many years ago and which I had persisted with through numerous system replacements. However it isn’t. I can say the mouse works 90-95% of the time, but when the 5-10% failure is sporadic in the midst of the 90% perfect functionality it results in a very jerky experience which makes precision mousework impossible. I get it’s not a ‘high end’ mouse but to clarify, my idea of precision mousework is clicking on the correct player on Football Manager. With this mouse I’m in danger of trying to bid on Troy Deeney and ending up buying Claude Dielna. NOT GOOD (Not least as I’m after a striker rather than a defender with an impressive Instagram account but no footballing ability). I also like to dabble on Photoshop, cutting out a mates face and pasting it into various hilarious places, you know, really highbrow entertainment… again this is almost impossible as even with the magic wand tool on Photoshop the jerky mouse movement means I end up picking up a heck of a lot of background or cutting off my mates ear. The keyboard isn’t quite so annoying as I use it far less, however this is also seemingly prone to fallout of signal. Thankfully the wonders of technology are such that when I google ‘whtv happno Ssa Boye’ it recognises what I want to type and brings me the required results, but this is no thanks to the keyboard itself (as an aside, what DID happen to Susan Boyle?!). The cause of the issues are unknown to me, could be any number of wireless signals bouncing around my house which are affecting the signal from the transmitter to the mouse / keyboard. I perhaps could rearrange my PC set up a bit to stop the interference but in this day and age I expect a wireless keyboard and mouse to work well (as my previous one did) and to not have to place my desktop PC in the ensuite to avoid pesky interference. Overall in the nine months I’ve owned and used this keyboard I can say it has had about ten ‘good days’, the rest has been hair pullingly bad and has put me off the idea of wireless mice and keyboards totally to such an extent the reason I’m on Amazon writing this review is that I’m here browsing wired variants. For what its worth the keyboard looks nice and the mouse is comfortable to use. If, like the 1,397 five star reviewers, you don’t have any negative experience then great, otherwise good luck putting together a squad capable of dominating domestically and on the continent with a bunch of players you had no intention of buying. Also do play Overcooked but use a gamepad or your kitchen will be on fire in no time thanks to the intermittent keyboard controls.","1.0","14 November 2017"
"","","Daisymay","First off, I was annoyed the keyboard came in its own packaging with no external coverage, making a desirable product vulnerable if left on the doorstep.  Second there were no instructions apart from a very basic set-up graphic on the box but no explanation of a row of hot keys - which seemed to be self explanatory but might not have been given the main problem I experienced, and couldn't be disabled. My main gripe was the triggering of a Microsoft Help page every time I used the delete key or control shift, or just when it felt it, opening the same page time after time after time. It was driving me insane, it continued opening pages when I was using social media and even worse overriding personal banking logins.  It ignored Block Pop-Up commands, also the connection occasionally cutout even though the WiFi control box is next to my desk.  In frustration, I've returned to my old wired Logitech keyboard and mouse and it hasn't happened since, so the obvious conclusion is that this is a faulty product. On the plus side it was a dream to set up, literally just plugging in the small toggle to a USB port and activating the batteries.  Being WiFi made my desk so much cleaner and less cluttered but I can't trust that it won't happen again, which is why I'm asking for a refund rather than a replacement.","1.0","17 August 2023"

The new mouse works as well as the old one but the keyboard either doesn't connect or lags badly and this is from someone who types slowly! My wife, who is a former journalist  types quickly and complains that for her it is terrible. I have searched online for solutions and tried everything such as moving the transmitter to a front usb port, changed settings on the device manager etc but basically is no good and we are reverting to our old wired keyboard.

"","","The Very Angry Maker","Just to let you know my review is based on my experience with the keyboard only and I did not try the mouse.... so just to let you know. It is with regret that I have to give this keyboard a one star review because I have been a loyal user of Logitech keyboard and mice for the last 15 years plus. I have a considerably more expensive Logitech keyboard on which one of the legs / risers has broken and I don't like typing onto a flat keyboard and didn't want to have to spend yet another £70 on a replacement keyboard so thought I would order this set because I thought surely it will work fine as a basic standard keyboard... I was wrong. The set arrived in an attractive blue box containing both the keyboard, mouse and the USB receiver. As I said I didn't even try the mouse just the keyboard. The keyboard does not work with the Logitech Unifying receiver (that came with my other keyboard and again with my mouse) which is strange so had to use the receiver that came with the set. The keyboard only has one height setting that was quite steep even for someone like me that likes a good angle / steepness to my keyboard which make typing on it quite uncomfortable due to the position the keyboard was forcing my wrists into so if like me you are planning to use this keyboard everyday I would look elsewhere for that reason alone. But the complete deal breaker came because the plastic on the riser legs is too thin and they are placed very close to the edges of the keyboard which makes the keyboard act like a wobbly / rocking restaurant table. The keyboard is on a perfectly flat desk it's just a very poor design / cheapness of materials used that causes the issue so can't imagine another one being any different. I understand this is a budget product but I did expect it to at least sit on a desk with no problems but to rock back and forth pretty much makes this keyboard unusable. In desperation I went to my local Tesco and bought one of their own brand keyboards for £5 and it doesn't rock and has a more pleasant typing angle / height..... I am surprised at Logitech putting out such a poorly designed product even at the lower end of the market but I suppose not every product can be a winner. So it's ultimately up to you if you want to roll the dice on this and see for yourself but honestly if you are going to be using this keyboard even for a little bit daily look elsewhere because this one will drive you crazy.","1.0","24 October 2017"

Too late to return to Amazon, the logitech warranty dance leaves me lamenting the day I bought such a cheap keyboard. The problem was that intermittently (as I see other reviewers have also noted) a Google or Edge help page would pop up. No its not malware or a virus, user ownership of helppane.exe, or a registry hack required, it's the keyboard randomly sending F1 commands. Who'd have thought? The keyboard is flimsy and simply flexing it is enough to trigger F1 key press. If you have a similar issue and read this in time, return it. The logitech warranty claim process is painfully long-winded and not worth it for the price of binning the keyboard.","1.0","18 October 2023"

"","","Ricol","Bought this combo to work with Ubuntu Desktop [21.04] running on Raspberry Pi 4 B [8Gb]. First issue was that mouse would only work if it was a couple of feet from the Pi. This was caused by wireless interference and was over come with an USB extension cable. So now, I can sit on my sofa (3m away) and the mouse works fine. However, the keyboard shows no sign of working. It powers up, proven by turning Caps Lock On/Off, but no keys work with the Pi. To test to see if it was faulty, I plugged both into a windows laptop and here the keyboard works [mouse was fine to] but every fifteen characters or so, the key input is automatically repeated a dozen times! Example of what I get when I type : When I type I get somethiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing like this! This happens on all keys including arrow keys, so its not just a sticky key. And its a pain in the backside when you are entering passwords!! All in all, I wish I hadn't bought this. I primarily wanted something cheap as its not going to see much use and when I read other reviews from people successfully using it on a Raspberry Pi, I thought this is the one for me. I'll give it one last try but if I cant find a solution to get it working with my version of Ubuntu, then I've little choice than to bin it and look for an alternative","1.0","27 May 2021"

"","","J.Loppy","I bought one of these to replace my old Dell hard wired keyboard and mouse. It worked fine for a couple of weeks until the keyboard and mouse became intermittent . I tried checking batteries which were absolutely OK and using a different USB socket for the dongle but it continued to play up. So I returned the whole package (keyboard and mouse) to Amazon who very efficiently replaced it with another Logi keyboard and mouse. Everything worked fine for a while but then the old problem reared its ugly head again. The keyboard and mouse (mainly keyboard) became intermittent. It is so frustrating that I have binned the keyboard in a fit of pique and gone back to me trusty old hard wired Dell keyboard. I would not wish anyone to go through the stress and inconvenience I have experienced with this particular Logi package. I cannot recommend this product and strongly suggest looking elsewhere. I have to say Amazon have been marvellous but as I've suffered this keyboard for over the guarantee period they are unable to help me any further.","1.0","10 February 2023"

After installing this combo I had truly horrendous issues which, confusingly, coincided with a Windows Update. It resulted in 6 hours of work on my laptop by Microsoft Technicians. The Windows Update appeared to roll-out an aggressive push by Microsoft to use MS Edge (well documented in geekdom) and which would (randomly) launch MS Edge or Bing 'Get Help On . . . ' webpages that could not be turned off. This resulted in 3 calls to Microsoft Tech Support who eventually removed the HelpPane.exe file that was throwing up the Help Screens. HOWEVER, subsequently, other random pop-ups occurred inside a (non Microsoft) program that I know extremely well. I immediately removed the new Logitech 270 keyboard and mouse and replaced them with older (worn out) ones: the problem went away. So I did some tests with the old Logitech wireless mouse and wired keyboard which pointed to the Logitech Unified Transmitter and the Mouse as being the problem. All of my Microsoft Edge / Bing / HelpPane.exe problems were a result of using a new Logitech 270 Combo. The culprit is the mouse which triggers random events that can result in a computer being filled with unwanted screens that can only be removed using Task Manager. The wireless keyboard initially appeared to be reliable; however, it (over a few hours) stopped linking. Throughout the repairs Microsoft Techs were very good indeed. Downloading or refreshing drivers might fix the problem, but my past experience is that Logitech are dilatory in updating drivers.  When I tried to find new drivers I found none that Windows wanted to use. I strongly recommend not using this combo on a Windows 10 computer.","1.0","21 December 2019"

"","","M Bennett","I've been using Logitec M185 mice for years.  They're on the small side but they're still comfortable, lightweight and rock solid.  I middle click a lot (constantly manipulating a 3d viewport for a living) and their only weakness is the middle button (scrollwheel) click and I'll kill it within 18 months.  I consider this fair use. Problems then: 1) Wireless connectivity wouldn't work with the receiver in the back of the PC -- back there it is right next to other USB devices, the video port and the RJ45 network wire but the original mouse receivers have all worked well where this one wouldn't.  It's not a big deal to use a USB port on the front of the PC but they already had their uses.  I tried updating the firmware (just in case) but the updater even find it's own receiver! 2) The keyboard is a nightmare and it's probably going in the bin soon.  The 'Enter' key on the numpad doesn't register unless it's hit at the top or really whacked.  It's entirely possible to hit the lower half of the key and hear all the correct mechanical keypress sounds without it registering.  This is making any data entry a nightmare and I feel I'm only one unregistered keypress away from a very expensive mistake.  I'm not sure I where I would stand returning as faulty because the key works if it's hit in the 'right place' and I doubt a replacement would act any differently.  I should post a video to show how unresponsive this key is.  You honestly wouldn't believe how many solid keypresses it takes to register one hit.","1.0","19 March 2020"

"","","Marcello","I'm dropping the rating from 4 to 1 star. A few weeks after buying this, it started acting up. It works only if I hold it close to the computer. I replaced the batteries, I updated the drivers, I updated windows, I installed logitech's own software. Nothing helps. Maybe there is some interference with another signal. The keys just stop working completely. ---------------- I love the sleep button. Do you see those 8 grey buttons on top? The second from right is the sleep button. Instead turning off the computer I leave it in sleep because it wakes up much faster. Therefore the sleep button is important but hard to find on keyboards. Do you see that on/off button on the right next to the Logitech logo? That one is useless. Why would anybody use that? It means if you turn off your keyboard every night you can save about 10p per month. So what? Why would I care? The keyboard works with 2 AAA batteries which are included. Build quality is very good. I had bought the same keyboard many years ago, maybe in 2008 and since then the quality has improved. The keys feel more solid and don't wobble around as much. The keyboard model says K270 under it. I don't like the mouse though. The mouse is too small. I hate reviewers who say small or big without any measurements. So, let me be specific. Mouse dimensions are length: 99mm, width: 60, height: 38. The mouse model is M185. It works with a single AA battery which is included. In comparison my old Logitech M100 mouse which is already small is 113/62/38mm. It does make a difference. This mouse is too small to use. I absolutely can't use it. That means I paid only for the keyboard. Therefore I give it 4 stars. If I knew I can't use the mouse, would I buy just the keyboard? Probably not because currently this item is £19.99 and just the keyboard is £18.99. You only save £1. Think of it as a backup mouse for £1.","1.0","9 June 2015"
"","","Uni student","I bought it after such great reviews and from my friends and people here. It worked for a bit and then stopped working entirely. Both mouse and keyboard and no it’s not the Bluetooth usb. They both stopped working. And not so compatible either. Too big to carry in a 50L bag even. It looks appearance wise quite basic but otherwise passable really. A pretty overpriced low quality keyboard and mouse.","1.0","26 October 2023"

"","","Karvala","The keyboard itself is okay, but longevity is an issue.  After substantial use, or if it gets significantly dusty, keys will begin to stick.  Otherwise, the keyboard is quite nice to use.# The mouse is too small to be comfortable; this is not a mouse that most people would enjoy using on a regular basis so be prepared to replace the mouse if you're planning on using it for a prolonged period. Based on the actual products, this would get 3/4 stars from me.  However, this was sold as new but the box was bashed, had clearly been previously opened (i.e. looked like a badly repackaged return) and there was no USB dongle in either the box or in the space in the mouse where it is supposed to be.  Clearly someone had stolen it and nobody bothered to check before sending it out again.  Very poor service.","1.0","22 November 2022"

"","","NS123","I bought this Logitech MK270 to replace my old Dell wired keyboard and mouse which had run flawlessly for three years until the mouse's right click broke.  I own a Logitech wheel which works very well, so I decided to buy this keyboard/mouse combo.  It was easy to set up, though you do need to download software which is not mentioned in the manual.  Both the mouse and the keyboard worked well for about a day.  My PC was in sleep mode and I moved the mouse to wake it up and it didn't work, neither did the keyboard.  I restarted the computer but just a few seconds after turning the PC on, a message appeared on the screen saying that a keyboard must be connected to boot the computer.  The Logitech Unifying receiver probably had broken due to both the keyboard and the mouse not working.  I had to go and fish the old Dell mouse and keyboard out of the bin so I could start the computer.  I tried all troubleshooting steps but nothing worked so I returned this item to Amazon for a replacement.  Amazon's customer service was great as usual and I received the replacement quickly.  The replacement mouse/keyboard installed fine and ran well for a few weeks.  I was using my PC when the mouse abruptly stopped working.  I tried everything I could again but it would not work.  The keyboard was still working but I returned the items to Amazon again, for a refund this time. The keyboard and mouse were comfortable and easy to use while they worked, but the mouse was a bit on the small side. I replaced the mouse/keyboard with the Logitech MK330 wireless combo.  This is worth the extra money - months later it is still working perfectly. I would not recommend this product, it appears to be very bad quality, although Logitech is a good brand and I would still buy their products.","1.0","21 February 2014"

I cannot state enough how much of a waste of money this is, please don't bother. It isn't worth it.

"","","C. C.","Update. I'm reducing this to 1 star - can't select none. After only four months of use, the keyboard is pretty much ready for the bin. Letters worn off keys I can cope with but I would expect them to last a few years, not weeks. But now the spacebar only works if you hit it in the exact centre, and several other keys are becoming difficult to get a clean press on. DO NOT BUY this keyboard if you type with any more than one finger a few times a month. I eventually worked out how to stop the mouse going nuts - you need to find and disable their smooth-scroll option.  The mouse is still too small. -- Mouse is also small - frankly a little too small, it would be fine for packing in a laptop bag where space is limited but it's a bit annoying that it was not advertise as a small mouse. AND IT'S USELESS with Google maps. No clue what they've done wrong here, and now I see I'm by no means the only person to have this.
