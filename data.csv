"","","Aftab khan","I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction. The transition: NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand). Face ID: I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode. It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook). What I love: - The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black). - The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it. - The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store. - I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth. - Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way. - The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera. - The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening. - The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it. What I don't: Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 4 March 2018"
"","","Syed","Apple has always been a coin with 2 sides, it has loyal followers who will swear by it and it has loyal critics who will feed of it. Now coming to the iPhone X. I will be speaking only about the phone and it’s features and not compare with other models. Pros- - Its  truly a beautiful phone. The notch in the top is something I feel u will want to have once u start using it. - the build quality is amazing. It’s a premium phone from the get go. Once u open the box, it’s like opening a Pandora’s box, something truly befitting a flagship.(of course it’s an year old now) - the screen resolution is just crisp and jaw dropping. Unlike its predecessors, the screen is gorgeous. Colours are spot on, the True Tone display needs some time to get used to but later there’s no turning back to the normal mode. The colours, no matter the time of the day, sunlight , no light, moonlight, tube light or what ever, always great. -the camera is very good being a dual camera and all and the pictures are pretty good, although I am not a avid mobile photographer. -the size of the phone is just right. At least for me it seems a good fit. Although sometimes 2 hands are required for some tasks but overall one handed most of the time. - Face ID- this is where it gets tricky. The phone unlocks with Face ID or a passcode. Now I have tried this feature with a beard , dim lighting , night times and many possible scenarios, and I must say , it’s good. Although it’s takes a few milliseconds more in low lighting, but over all good. (PS NOTE- there is no finger print unlock !!!!!!!) - The phone is truly fast. Multitasking, heavy gaming, anything is like a walk in the park for the phone. It’s truly a beast with it processing speed. Doesn’t warm up even when doing multiple tasks or playing PUBG. You have to understand that apple uses its RAM in a different way, so 3gb RAM may seem little on paper but don’t let numbers fool you. Cons- - battery life - now the battery life for the average usage is good but for gaming and heavy usage I feel is a bit disappointing. Could have been better, but hey, that’s what power banks are there for. - headphone jack- this is truly frustrating sometimes!!!! I mean come on!!!!! Who will manufacture Bose or sony  or beats headphones with a lighting cable!!!!!!!! U will have to carry the connector all the time or leave it attached to ur headphones all the time to avoid forgetting them in a hurry. These are just a few points I have noticed after using the phone for sometime, will update if I feel anything is needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 29 October 2018"
"","","ShowrobDa","This is my 3rd iPhone after iPhone 4S and iPhone 6S Plus. Being an utter working middle class guy, I don't switch my iPhones very often (my android phones barely lasted me 9 months though). I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it. Pros: - I got this phone for INR 69,999/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy. - It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K. - Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12. - The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones. - Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser. Cons: - The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later. - The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector - Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly. - Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max. - The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely. - With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 12 October 2018"
"","","Karmicfruits","This phone carries with itself great hype and consequently great expectations. In my experience, having had both the 8 plus and this, the main perceivable differences between both are in the size, the edge to edge display, front camera portrait mode, the absence of the home button, the new UI gestures and of course FaceID. How well are these implemented? • UI gestures- The new way of navigation is very well implemented and I have not experienced any difficulties in adapting to or using them The swipe up gesture to go home, swipe right and hold for multitasking etc are really easy and intuitive. People have been complaining about the control centre now a swipe down from the top right corner. But I ask how is this different from the notifications and quick toggle on Android which is also a swipe down from the top? With the new breed of 18:9 screen aspect ratio Android phones which are taller than ever before, this gesture is none the easier. I give it a score of 7.5/10 • FaceID- Works like a charm. The sensors are very forgiving of the angle but it won’t work if you’re holding your phone upside down or sideways. Apart from that, it works very well. It has a wide range of view. You don’t have to be dead centre in front of the phone for it to unlock. Works with sunglasses and spectacles and has no problem either in pitch dark or bright sunlight as long as the sun is not on your face or behind you. Prospective buyers shouldn’t have any apprehensions regarding it. Apple has given us a very good alternative to TouchID. It scores 8/10 • Front camera portrait- Nothing special. You have to try several times for it to give an acceptable result. Doesn’t compare well with the Pixel 2 phones. Yet, the skin tones on the iPhone are always far more natural than its Android counterparts. Doesn’t deserve more than 6/10 • OLED Display- You really have to look for differences between the IPS LCD of the 8 plus and the X. Apple does such a good job with the calibration of their displays that, frankly, I don’t see much difference in the quality of colours between the OLED iPhone X and the LCD 8 plus. Yes the OLED has more contrast compared to the LCD but if you’re looking to buy a phone purely for the punchy saturation and vividness of an OLED display, this is not it. You’d do well to look at the Samsung Note8. Apple always favours colour accuracy over vividness. The display quality deserves an 8/10 • Battery life is better than the 8 but worse than the 8 plus. There’s no competition. If you’re a heavy user, you will not get a full day’s use out of it. Plus, charging it is even slower than the 8 plus as the battery is actually bigger in size. Wireless charging is on board but is very slow in my experience. I have the Samsung fast charger that comes with the Note8 and use it to charge this phone. The battery scores 6/10. • Animoji- Fun if you spend too much time messaging people on iMessage. The novelty of it will wear off. The problem is that Apple has made us think it is some futuristic cutting edge tech built into its TrueDepth sensors when it actually isn’t. It is just using the front camera for face tracking and there’s no reason why it can’t be ported over to the 8 or older iPhones. But we know that is never going to happen. Apple will keep updating new characters to keep Animoji interesting. I give it a 5/10 because it is marketed as something which it isn’t. MY SCORE - 6.75/10 • FAQs- 1- How is the size and in-hand feel?-  The size of the phone is much more manageable in one hand. The screen is narrower and gives less screen space than the plus model. It feels solid and premium in the hand. No creaking sounds yet. 2- How bad is ""The Notch""? - Doesn’t bother me anywhere outside Youtube videos or other video streaming platforms. It does cut into the video if you decide to expand the video to make full use of the available screen. It’s not noticeable in general usage like browsing, social media or messaging. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS- In my experience, one has to look at both the iPhone 8/8plus and the iPhone X in isolation to fully appreciate them. If one spends time comparing them, they’re bound to feel frustrated as there are far too many similarities to justify the huge price difference. If you’re someone who must have the shiniest offering from Apple, then the X is for you. But, if you want bang for your buck, then go for the 8 plus, as it is pound for pound the better phone between the two. The differences are simply not enough to justify spending extra. The camera performance, processor, RAM, storage options, apps, software features are the same and the X doesn’t offer as many extras that make it stand apart from its sibling. Maybe next year, Apple? IS IT WORTH IT?- There won’t be a cop out here. If you're contemplating between this and the 8 plus, in my opinion, to buy this phone, this year, at this price, is not worth it. (My purchase price was 87.5k). Even if you can afford it, or have an iPhone above the 6s/Plus, you can skip it without much remorse. iPhone 7/7 plus are still great phones and if you can hold off another year, then the 2018 lineup of iPhones is shaping up to be pretty exciting. Compared to the iPhone 8 plus, all the features this phone offers either looked at in isolation or even as a whole, do not justify getting it. Going forward, all iPhones are going to be designed like this and improve upon it. It’s not a limited edition model which is a must have. If this is going to be your first iPhone or if you're looking to upgrade from an iPhone 6 or 6s, go ahead. It is a great phone and you won't regret getting it. I have put photos of the phone here. For the camera samples, please see my iPhone 8 plus review as there is no difference in photo quality between the two. Here is the link--- https://www.amazon.in/gp/review/R6DSET4ETOTXH/ref=pdp_new_read_full_review_link?ie=UTF8 X vs XS- The hardware upgrades between the X and XS are as follows- The speakers are slightly better, the camera records video in stereo mode, the water resistance rating has improved from IP67 to IP68, there is 4GB RAM now, the bokeh is adjustable in the portrait shots, Smart HDR takes multi frame pics like the Pixel 2, photos have much improved dynamic range and there’s a new gold colour. Apart from the camera improvements, there is not much that markedly improve your experience if you’ve been using the X the past year. Apple knows this too and have positioned the XS and XS Max as upgrades for people using older iPhones. (6, 6s, 7, 8) If you’re using any of these phones, the upgrade makes sense. iPhone X users are better off waiting till next year. Price update as on October 9, 2018- Since the 64GB iPhone X is now available at 69,990/- on Amazon, it is a better deal and worth considering for all those who have waited all this while and stayed away from the X due to the high price tag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 26 January 2018"
"","","Digital Panache","The media could not be loaded. I'm speechless after using it for over a month now. This is a beautiful beast by Apple. It's expensive but it's worth every penny. This phone looks royal. Super royal.. Display - I have seen many phones, but this display is rocking. It's crystal clean and super bright. It's amazing to see apple fit 5.8 inch in a phone that's barely bigger than iphone 6. This is an OLED screen which is pretty good in sun as well. Glass back - the glass back adds to the beauty and makes this stand out from the rest. It looks uber cool. Wireless Charging - A life saver. Buy a wireless charger and forget those charging wires forever. Water and dust resistance - It's not waterproof. So don't go swimming with it. but I liked the design, it's pretty good in being water resistant. Camera - oh boy. iPhone camera is super amazing. The pics are hi-res crystal clear and image stablization is high end. Camera modes are too good as well. Face ID - This has been a point of contention but it works like butter. Super smooth. I hardly have to key in the PIN once or twice a week. It recognizes in my face in specs, shades and even in a cap. Nothing else is required. I'm happy. Processor and speed - Can play anything on it. You just won't be disappointed with power and speed. Super awesome again. Verdict It's a royal device. Looks good on you. Keeps you happy. Works like charm. Just BUY it. People say Apple is not VFM but I upgraded from iPhone 6 to this after 4 years and my iPhone 6 still works like a new one. It's totally VFM.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 23 November 2018"
"","","Avishek De","Apple iPhone X (Silver, 64GB) Apple is always known for their build quality and flawless software and the iPhone X is the epitome of their innovation. Have been using it for three weeks now and can safely say that this the best phone currently available in the market, with the Pixel XL a distant second. Pros: - the end to end retina display is absolutely amazing. Apple TrueTone display adjusts better than Android phones with changes in ambient light - software: iOS 11.2.5 is very user friendly and intuitive. My phone hasnt ever lagged or stuttered so far. - pretty good battery backup (easily lasting for an entire day on normal usage) - FaceID is a whole new ball game and apple wins it hands down. It is extremely accurate and easy to use and unlocks your phone as fast as fingerprint and even works in the dark. It is also secure as it checks if you are looking at the phone before performing a FaceID action. This is by far the best feature I felt on iPhone X and is a class apart from android phones. - the camera is really good in daylight and has a host of new features which includes portrait mode. Cons: - I personally dont like the notch at the top and makes the display look a little ugly. - Fast charger is not provided in the box. The charger provided takes very long (~1 hr 45 min) to charge the phone. - Earphones provided are not of the best quality. - Front camera is pretty average and doesnt take exceptional pictures under dim lighting conditions. That said, iPhone X is overpriced and is definitely not value for money. But if you are willing to shell off money to get the best phone in the market then this is what you should buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 10 February 2018"
"","","Veda Prakash Chinta","Well, let me start by saying this- iPhone X is a fantastic phone, easily beats every expectation, there has never been a hint of doubt about it. I have been Android user most of my life I started off with using HTC Wildfire, then - Galaxy S3, HTC One M7, Lumia 920 (Windows), Moto X Play and Galaxy S7. My wife has been using Android as well - HTC Wildfire, Galaxy Note 2, Oppo F7, now Nokia 8. So, I can say I pretty much used most of what Android has to offer, therefore, I wanted to get myself an iPhone. Initially, there was a lot of resistance from me to go for iPhone as I have heard from people that it is not that user friendly or has less functionality, more restrictive etc etc.... however, I wanted to try it strongly- so bought iPhone X. I will come out and say that it was not a fantastic move from Android, but more of a “change over” kind of move. iPhone isn’t as much better than Android as people say it is... however, it comes with its own bells and whistles. Screen- top notch, (Samsung had this from a while though), Camera - best in segment (better than Galaxy S9), Speaker - Fantastic, Apps- well, no issues here, Battery- did not expect this would last so long.. GREAT ENDURANCE. Now, iOS is not as loaded as Android, so, do not expect it to do all the stuff that Android does, but it is very smooth and fluidic. Never faced a jitter or frozen screen. It’s very secure, intuitive in its own way. The best part is- no nonsensical bloatware that eats up your storage. I saw Android needing “Factory reset” every couple of months to work smoothly- iOS does not need this- the one USP for me. So, if you have to take my advise, go for it if you have faced issues with Android else, no need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 19 September 2019"
"","","Ktron","Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k. Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine. iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an ""IN"" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!! Pros: 1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it 2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking 3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm’s chips has always been better than Intel’s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901. Cons: 1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage. So recommend having a case around it (preferably a transparent one so that the beauty of the original phone can still be enjoyed!) 2) I have to say that battery life is average - a shade better than iPhone 8. 3) Additional touch id support would have been better as an alternative unlocking option Will come up with a detailed review soon in a couple of weeks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 11 October 2018"
"","","The Honest Guy","I have recently ordered iPhone for my cousin and you can find below my review on the product based on a weeks usage. I will update this again after a month of use. Personally i have been a iPhone user for a long time now and yes i use Android phones also, because i am an app developer. iPhone X Pros - Size and design, iPhone X is an unbelievably designed device, that feels so sleek and handy. It is slightly larger than iPhone 8 but smaller than iPhone 8 S. I have attached images taken from Apple store for comparison. - Camera - It has the best ever camera on an iPhone. I said on iPhone, because there are devices like Pixel 2, Mi 8 , Huawei P20 Pro that comes with half the price of iPhone x and better camera. - Shooting videos - I have always noticed that iPhone offers an edge in video quality over other phones of similar specs - Waterproof - iPhone X is rated IP67. A lot of people lose their phones due to water damage. Sometimes, an iphone can save you from buying a new phone, which is a kind of cost saving. Especially if you spend a lot of time in pool, outdoor activities this might be a boon. Also you can shoot a lot of underground videos. Cons - Costly, yes iPhone X comes at a very premium price. It's a phone made for high class category only - If you are looking for best camera phone, go for something else. You can get a Pixel 2, Mi8 , or P20 for less than half price. These phones have better Dxomark scores than iPhoneX. Head on to Dxo Mark website and check. Being an iPhone user for a long time, i would also like to list a few cons and pros of using iPhone compared to Android iPhone Pros - If you have a mac, iPhone can work seamlessly with mac. The same apps are available for mac and iPhone which syncs seamlessly. Calendar, TODOs, Notes, Contacts etc helps me a lot. I add a todo from my mac and next moment i have it on my phone too. That works great. - If you are someone who is hooked up to mac always, you can easily attend your calls on mac ig both devices are on same network. I have found this really helpful - Apple makes the best non bud type earphones in my experience. Personally i do not like in ear canal earphones as they can impair hearing. I have found no other good alternatives to Apple earphones in terms of audio clarity. But yes you can get better over the ear or in canal earphones. - Physical button for silent mode - Yes, thats a quick and comfy shortcut to turn your phone silent even without unlocking it/turning screen on. If you are a person who attends a lot of meetings and requires to turn phone silent, this can be quite helpful. You can quickly check the button position and say your phone is silent or not. iPhone Cons -  Accessories are costly - If you need to buy an extra cable(maybe for office) or adapter, you need to shell somewhere between 1500 to 2500 bucks. Chinese accessories won't work well and perfect with iPhone - iOS is buggy at times. I have to admit that. Not just that, apple bug fixing is very slow compared to Googles Android -  Apple music is slighly costly comapred to Google music - 120 rs per month If you are looking for cheaper alternatives, i would suggest you the Google Pixel 2. Google pixel comes with Unlimited Original quality photo and video storage. On iPhone, for the same thing you have to shell out additional 75INR per month for 50 GB. For higher storage you need to pay more. If you are a person who shoots a lot of videos, Googles Unlimited storage can save you a lot of money. However you can install Google photos and get Unlimited Normal backup for photos and videos on any iOS/Android phone, where Google converts the files to reduce quality. For images, its quite ok, the difference is barely noticeable, but for videos yes , they convert it to One-fourth the size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 9 July 2018"
"","","Nabeel Ehtesham","The X might have the thinnest screen bezels of any iPhone, but it could only get there by ditching the physical home button. That also meant getting rid of TouchID fingerprint scanning, so instead we get FaceID facial recognition. It takes two cameras (one regular, one IR) an IR dot emitter and separate IR flood illuminator to accurately scan and recognise your face in less than half a second, and all that tech takes up space. The way it bulges out into the display is certainly unique. It’s a bit like Marmite - you either love the distinctive look, or you hate the way it intrudes on your screen space. After a week with the phone, I’m in the former camp - although the effect it has on software is another matter. Open an app that hasn’t been updated yet and you’ll get massive black borders at the top and bottom of the screen, or left and right when you’re in landscape. The notch is unmissable in this mode when you open Safari, with certain web pages looking downright ugly. Apps that use Apple’s autolayout fill the screen, but not always how you’d expect - sometimes blocking out the battery indicator or losing UI elements offscreen. Even apps that have been updated can look a little funky. The fact that big names like Spotify didn’t have updated apps ready to go on launch day is a bit of a joke. But anyway, back to the screen itself. It’s a 5.8in panel, technically making it larger than the iPhone 8 Plus, but the 19.5:9 aspect ratio means it’s more like an iPhone 8 stretched vertically. Add in the notch and that’s quite a lot of dead space in certain apps and games. Honestly, though? It’s difficult to mind that much - the screen is absolutely phenomenal. That’s mainly down to the switch from LCD to OLED, giving the X the impeccable contrast and deep, inky blacks that have been impressing us on Samsung’s Galaxy phones for years. Resolution has leapt up to 2436x1125, a big change from the iPhone 8 Plus and its 1080p panel. Pentile panel tech might not resolve as much detail as an RGB LCD screen, but some clever anti-aliasing on Apple’s part means it’s difficult to spot any lack of detail. OLED panels can end up so looking ridiculously vibrant you’ll want to wear sunglasses whenever you look at them, but Apple has been pretty restrained here: photos and videos on the X still pop with colour, but they stay on the right side of realistic. TrueTone colour calibration helps here, automatically tweaking the colour temperature to match the ambient light around you. It’s a subtle effect, but you’ll notice the difference when you flick it on and off in the settings screen. It gets impressively bright for an OLED panel, too. I had no problem reading the screen outdoors on a sunny day. That brightness comes in handy for HDR video - the X supports both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. Netflix is already updated, and works great on a good connection, with a great range of colour and more depth to dark scenes. For all the pitchforks and torches banging on Google’s door over the Pixel 2 XL’s off-angle colour shift, the iPhone X isn’t immune from the effects either. With no home button, the X makes you rethink how to use your iPhone. And it all starts with FaceID. Instead of tapping the fingerprint sensor, you now raise the phone, tap anywhere onscreen or press the side button to wake it, then swipe up from the bottom of the display to get past the lock screen. Normally, in the time you’ve done all that, FaceID has fired out thousands of tiny infra red dots, scanned them with an IR camera, and mapped your face. All your contours, curves, bumps and ridges make for a unique ID that’s even more difficult to fool than a fingerprint sensor. As you’ve only got one face (I hope), you don’t have to consider which hand you’ll be picking up the phone with, or to hold it in a certain way so your finger lines up with a physical button - handy if you found the iPhone 8 just a little bit too small, or the Plus that little bit too big. When FaceID works, it works brilliantly, taking less than half a second to recognise you and unlock the phone. Over time, it’ll get better at recognising you, tracking things like hair and beard growth so as not to get confused. Go for a shave and buzzcut and you might need to retrain it, though. It worked through sunglasses, while I was wearing chunky headphones, and with a hoodie covering my hair, but leaning my hand on my chin could sometimes defeat it. Lying in bed, I would often hold the phone too close to get a match, and it’s harder to unlock while sat on your desk than the old TouchID system. It might not be 100% accurate, but it’s still better than any other face scanner we’ve tried on a phone, including the ones found on some Samsungs. When it does fail, you’ve got to tap in a passcode - just like you would with TouchID. It’s not exactly elegant, but it’s rare enough not to be annoying - unless you’re stood at a London Underground ticket barrier, with a queue of people behind you. Double-tapping the side button to invoke Apple Pay and waiting for a face match feels a little bit slower than the old TouchID system, but maybe that’ll change once it becomes second nature. All these face-scanning shenanigans might sound serious, but there’s a lighter side to it all too. Fire up iMessage and you can play with Animoji: animated emoji characters that you can move with your face. By motion-tracking your facial features, the phone can animate your eyes and expressions perfectly, recording your voice in sync for sending as messages to your mates. It’s purely for fun, and all but guaranteed to annoy your non-iPhone X equipped mates, but undeniably cute at the same time. While the notch might seem like a big deal, it totally disappears once you’ve spent a few hours with the phone. With most day-to-day tasks, you won’t really notice it, especially when using the iPhone X in portrait mode. What you will notice over time is how the entire iOS UI has been redesigned around it. Until now, iPhone models have had an ever-present (unless you are in the full-screen mode) bar that’s been used to display all kinds of important information from the time, to signal strength, and to even indicate if some app is using your location information. With the iPhone X’s notch, there’s very little space for all this information - the left side is taken up entirely by the clock, while the right only has room for the signal strength indicator, 3G/ 4G/ Wi-Fi indicator, and the battery icon. You no longer see things like the name of the network, which might not seem like a big loss, but there are two other compromises that will potentially be more upsetting for most users. The battery percentage and Bluetooth connection status are now only visible only if you swipe down from the right of the notch, and there’s no way to have them always visible. If you use Bluetooth devices like AirPods, speakers, or in-car units, you can no longer tell at a glance if your phone is connected. The notch will bother you in full-screen games and videos, or if you use the your phone in landscape mode a lot. By default, the aspect ratio of the iPhone X’s display means that most videos will play with thick enough black bands on the left and right that the notch will blend in without any problems. However, if you choose to zoom in - by using pinch-to-zoom in the YouTube app for example - you bring the notch into play, even as the video gets cropped like on any other device. We regularly watched videos zoomed-in and it didn’t bother us one bit, but your mileage may vary. On the other hand, we did like some of the changes that the notch’s presence has resulted in. One of our favourite iOS features is the ability to scroll to the top of any list or page by tapping the bar at top. However, if some app is using your location in the background, or if some device is connected to the hotspot on your phone, this functionality breaks as tapping on the bar then takes you to the app using your location in the background, or the Hotspot settings, as the case may be. With the iPhone X, the location/ hotspot alerts are restricted to the left “ear”, which means you can still tap the notch or the right ear to scroll to the top of any list - that’s right, the notch does recognise your taps. We’ve spent considerable time talking about the notch, but if you are wondering what exactly it is, this little section is for you. With the iPhone X doing away with the Home button - and with it the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, Apple needed a new way for us to quickly and securely log in to our devices and authorise payments. The solution is Face ID, and the notch contains the front camera and 3D sensing sensors that make this technology possible. The three main components here are the infrared camera, flood illuminator, and dot projector. The latter projects “more than 30,000 invisible dots” onto your face to build a 3D map that can be used to identify you. The flood illuminator makes it possible to do that in the dark by emitting invisible infrared light, and the infrared camera reads the dot pattern. The infrared image is sent to the Secure Enclave in the A11 Bionic chip - a special area that’s used to store biometric data on the chip that powers the iPhone X - to confirm a match. Like with Touch ID, Apple says no biometric data actually leaves the device at any point, which means that your privacy is assured. The day the iPhone X was announced - and well before we had spent any meaningful time with it - we said that Face ID felt like a compromise, that it could never be as fast as Touch ID, and that Apple would go back to using fingerprint scanners as soon as it could figure out how to embed them into the glass fronts of its phones . A couple of months into having used the iPhone X, it’s safe to say that while Face ID might not have the raw speed of Touch ID, a move away from Face ID won’t be because of any significant drawbacks in the technology. It works seamlessly on most occasions, and more reliably than we’d imagined it would going into our review. It’s almost like having any no passcode or security feature on your device. That might not be a change for many people - despite manufacturers’ warnings during the setup process, we find an uncomfortably large number of people continue to use their smartphones without a passcode - but for everyone else, Face ID reduces the extra step of unlocking your phone before you can use it.Granted, most of us had become accustomed to using fingerprints to the point that it never felt like an “additional step”, but now, at most times, you can just pick up your iPhone X and trust that Face ID is just authenticating you in the background. For all practical purposes, this feels like using a phone without a passcode. This is especially great when you are interacting with notifications. Before the iPhone X, tapping on a notification - say, to read an email - on a locked device meant using Touch ID or needing to enter passcode to unlock before you could proceed. With Face ID, the additional step is removed, and you can now interact with notifications as originally intended The ‘notch’ is where all the Face ID bits are housed Face ID isn’t perfect, though, but then neither was Touch ID; the fingerprint scanner was poor if your fingers were slightly greasy or wet. This isn’t a problem now. However, I have found that Face ID struggles if my eyes are a shrivelled mess, usually first thing in the morning, and if the phone isn’t close enough to my face. If you’re the type of person who tries to sneak a look at their notifications with your phone at pocket-level then you’re out of luck. Apps that previously used Touch ID as a means of unlocking will automatically be replaced by Face ID without the need for an update, and you can of course use it for Apple Pay payments too. iPhone X – Screen The iPhone X sees Apple switch out its usual LCD screen tech for an OLED panel for the first time. Samsung, Google and many other Android phone makers have been using this technology for some time now, and it’s nice to see Apple finally joining the fray with a product other than the Apple Watch. This is also the highest-resolution screen ever on an iPhone, with a slightly odd 2436 x 1125 pixels, plus there’s support for the DCI P3 colour gamut and Dolby Vision HDR. OLEDs offer better contrast, true blacks and a more colourful picture, but they’re not always perfect. The LG panels used by Google in the Pixel 2 XL have come in for plenty of criticism for poor viewing angles and an odd blue tinge. Even the excellent screen on the Samsung Galaxy S8 is prone to suffering poor viewing angles. Apple’s OLEDs come from Samsung, and while there’s a small shift to blue if you tilt the device off-axis, it’s far less noticeable than on the Pixel 2 XL. Apple says it’s made a fair few tweaks to this panel, and the company’s optimisation of it is certainly different to Samsung’s approach for its own Galaxy S8 and Note 8 panels. Colours on the iPhone X are more natural and the saturation isn’t quite so intense. At last...... The Good A great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous OLED screen. Rear telephoto camera outshoots the 8 Plus in low light, and the front camera snaps impressive portrait selfies. Face ID generally works fine. The Bad New interface and no home button mean major adjustments, and key features such as the Control Center are harder to reach and use. It’ll take time for most apps to be optimized for notched screen. The phone is hella expensive, and the all-glass design means a case and an insurance plan are musts. Shorter battery life than iPhone Plus models. The Bottom Line iPhone X is an overdue and winning evolution of the iPhone, but you’ll need to leave your comfort zone to make a jump into the face-recognizing future.

"","","Aftab khan","I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction. The transition: NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand). Face ID: I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode. It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook). What I love: - The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black). - The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it. - The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store. - I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth. - Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way. - The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera. - The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening. - The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it. What I don't: Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 4 March 2018"
"","","Syed","Apple has always been a coin with 2 sides, it has loyal followers who will swear by it and it has loyal critics who will feed of it. Now coming to the iPhone X. I will be speaking only about the phone and it’s features and not compare with other models. Pros- - Its  truly a beautiful phone. The notch in the top is something I feel u will want to have once u start using it. - the build quality is amazing. It’s a premium phone from the get go. Once u open the box, it’s like opening a Pandora’s box, something truly befitting a flagship.(of course it’s an year old now) - the screen resolution is just crisp and jaw dropping. Unlike its predecessors, the screen is gorgeous. Colours are spot on, the True Tone display needs some time to get used to but later there’s no turning back to the normal mode. The colours, no matter the time of the day, sunlight , no light, moonlight, tube light or what ever, always great. -the camera is very good being a dual camera and all and the pictures are pretty good, although I am not a avid mobile photographer. -the size of the phone is just right. At least for me it seems a good fit. Although sometimes 2 hands are required for some tasks but overall one handed most of the time. - Face ID- this is where it gets tricky. The phone unlocks with Face ID or a passcode. Now I have tried this feature with a beard , dim lighting , night times and many possible scenarios, and I must say , it’s good. Although it’s takes a few milliseconds more in low lighting, but over all good. (PS NOTE- there is no finger print unlock !!!!!!!) - The phone is truly fast. Multitasking, heavy gaming, anything is like a walk in the park for the phone. It’s truly a beast with it processing speed. Doesn’t warm up even when doing multiple tasks or playing PUBG. You have to understand that apple uses its RAM in a different way, so 3gb RAM may seem little on paper but don’t let numbers fool you. Cons- - battery life - now the battery life for the average usage is good but for gaming and heavy usage I feel is a bit disappointing. Could have been better, but hey, that’s what power banks are there for. - headphone jack- this is truly frustrating sometimes!!!! I mean come on!!!!! Who will manufacture Bose or sony  or beats headphones with a lighting cable!!!!!!!! U will have to carry the connector all the time or leave it attached to ur headphones all the time to avoid forgetting them in a hurry. These are just a few points I have noticed after using the phone for sometime, will update if I feel anything is needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 29 October 2018"
"","","ShowrobDa","This is my 3rd iPhone after iPhone 4S and iPhone 6S Plus. Being an utter working middle class guy, I don't switch my iPhones very often (my android phones barely lasted me 9 months though). I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it. Pros: - I got this phone for INR 69,999/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy. - It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K. - Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12. - The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones. - Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser. Cons: - The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later. - The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector - Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly. - Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max. - The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely. - With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 12 October 2018"
"","","Karmicfruits","This phone carries with itself great hype and consequently great expectations. In my experience, having had both the 8 plus and this, the main perceivable differences between both are in the size, the edge to edge display, front camera portrait mode, the absence of the home button, the new UI gestures and of course FaceID. How well are these implemented? • UI gestures- The new way of navigation is very well implemented and I have not experienced any difficulties in adapting to or using them The swipe up gesture to go home, swipe right and hold for multitasking etc are really easy and intuitive. People have been complaining about the control centre now a swipe down from the top right corner. But I ask how is this different from the notifications and quick toggle on Android which is also a swipe down from the top? With the new breed of 18:9 screen aspect ratio Android phones which are taller than ever before, this gesture is none the easier. I give it a score of 7.5/10 • FaceID- Works like a charm. The sensors are very forgiving of the angle but it won’t work if you’re holding your phone upside down or sideways. Apart from that, it works very well. It has a wide range of view. You don’t have to be dead centre in front of the phone for it to unlock. Works with sunglasses and spectacles and has no problem either in pitch dark or bright sunlight as long as the sun is not on your face or behind you. Prospective buyers shouldn’t have any apprehensions regarding it. Apple has given us a very good alternative to TouchID. It scores 8/10 • Front camera portrait- Nothing special. You have to try several times for it to give an acceptable result. Doesn’t compare well with the Pixel 2 phones. Yet, the skin tones on the iPhone are always far more natural than its Android counterparts. Doesn’t deserve more than 6/10 • OLED Display- You really have to look for differences between the IPS LCD of the 8 plus and the X. Apple does such a good job with the calibration of their displays that, frankly, I don’t see much difference in the quality of colours between the OLED iPhone X and the LCD 8 plus. Yes the OLED has more contrast compared to the LCD but if you’re looking to buy a phone purely for the punchy saturation and vividness of an OLED display, this is not it. You’d do well to look at the Samsung Note8. Apple always favours colour accuracy over vividness. The display quality deserves an 8/10 • Battery life is better than the 8 but worse than the 8 plus. There’s no competition. If you’re a heavy user, you will not get a full day’s use out of it. Plus, charging it is even slower than the 8 plus as the battery is actually bigger in size. Wireless charging is on board but is very slow in my experience. I have the Samsung fast charger that comes with the Note8 and use it to charge this phone. The battery scores 6/10. • Animoji- Fun if you spend too much time messaging people on iMessage. The novelty of it will wear off. The problem is that Apple has made us think it is some futuristic cutting edge tech built into its TrueDepth sensors when it actually isn’t. It is just using the front camera for face tracking and there’s no reason why it can’t be ported over to the 8 or older iPhones. But we know that is never going to happen. Apple will keep updating new characters to keep Animoji interesting. I give it a 5/10 because it is marketed as something which it isn’t. MY SCORE - 6.75/10 • FAQs- 1- How is the size and in-hand feel?-  The size of the phone is much more manageable in one hand. The screen is narrower and gives less screen space than the plus model. It feels solid and premium in the hand. No creaking sounds yet. 2- How bad is ""The Notch""? - Doesn’t bother me anywhere outside Youtube videos or other video streaming platforms. It does cut into the video if you decide to expand the video to make full use of the available screen. It’s not noticeable in general usage like browsing, social media or messaging. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS- In my experience, one has to look at both the iPhone 8/8plus and the iPhone X in isolation to fully appreciate them. If one spends time comparing them, they’re bound to feel frustrated as there are far too many similarities to justify the huge price difference. If you’re someone who must have the shiniest offering from Apple, then the X is for you. But, if you want bang for your buck, then go for the 8 plus, as it is pound for pound the better phone between the two. The differences are simply not enough to justify spending extra. The camera performance, processor, RAM, storage options, apps, software features are the same and the X doesn’t offer as many extras that make it stand apart from its sibling. Maybe next year, Apple? IS IT WORTH IT?- There won’t be a cop out here. If you're contemplating between this and the 8 plus, in my opinion, to buy this phone, this year, at this price, is not worth it. (My purchase price was 87.5k). Even if you can afford it, or have an iPhone above the 6s/Plus, you can skip it without much remorse. iPhone 7/7 plus are still great phones and if you can hold off another year, then the 2018 lineup of iPhones is shaping up to be pretty exciting. Compared to the iPhone 8 plus, all the features this phone offers either looked at in isolation or even as a whole, do not justify getting it. Going forward, all iPhones are going to be designed like this and improve upon it. It’s not a limited edition model which is a must have. If this is going to be your first iPhone or if you're looking to upgrade from an iPhone 6 or 6s, go ahead. It is a great phone and you won't regret getting it. I have put photos of the phone here. For the camera samples, please see my iPhone 8 plus review as there is no difference in photo quality between the two. Here is the link--- https://www.amazon.in/gp/review/R6DSET4ETOTXH/ref=pdp_new_read_full_review_link?ie=UTF8 X vs XS- The hardware upgrades between the X and XS are as follows- The speakers are slightly better, the camera records video in stereo mode, the water resistance rating has improved from IP67 to IP68, there is 4GB RAM now, the bokeh is adjustable in the portrait shots, Smart HDR takes multi frame pics like the Pixel 2, photos have much improved dynamic range and there’s a new gold colour. Apart from the camera improvements, there is not much that markedly improve your experience if you’ve been using the X the past year. Apple knows this too and have positioned the XS and XS Max as upgrades for people using older iPhones. (6, 6s, 7, 8) If you’re using any of these phones, the upgrade makes sense. iPhone X users are better off waiting till next year. Price update as on October 9, 2018- Since the 64GB iPhone X is now available at 69,990/- on Amazon, it is a better deal and worth considering for all those who have waited all this while and stayed away from the X due to the high price tag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 26 January 2018"
"","","Digital Panache","The media could not be loaded. I'm speechless after using it for over a month now. This is a beautiful beast by Apple. It's expensive but it's worth every penny. This phone looks royal. Super royal.. Display - I have seen many phones, but this display is rocking. It's crystal clean and super bright. It's amazing to see apple fit 5.8 inch in a phone that's barely bigger than iphone 6. This is an OLED screen which is pretty good in sun as well. Glass back - the glass back adds to the beauty and makes this stand out from the rest. It looks uber cool. Wireless Charging - A life saver. Buy a wireless charger and forget those charging wires forever. Water and dust resistance - It's not waterproof. So don't go swimming with it. but I liked the design, it's pretty good in being water resistant. Camera - oh boy. iPhone camera is super amazing. The pics are hi-res crystal clear and image stablization is high end. Camera modes are too good as well. Face ID - This has been a point of contention but it works like butter. Super smooth. I hardly have to key in the PIN once or twice a week. It recognizes in my face in specs, shades and even in a cap. Nothing else is required. I'm happy. Processor and speed - Can play anything on it. You just won't be disappointed with power and speed. Super awesome again. Verdict It's a royal device. Looks good on you. Keeps you happy. Works like charm. Just BUY it. People say Apple is not VFM but I upgraded from iPhone 6 to this after 4 years and my iPhone 6 still works like a new one. It's totally VFM.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 23 November 2018"
"","","Avishek De","Apple iPhone X (Silver, 64GB) Apple is always known for their build quality and flawless software and the iPhone X is the epitome of their innovation. Have been using it for three weeks now and can safely say that this the best phone currently available in the market, with the Pixel XL a distant second. Pros: - the end to end retina display is absolutely amazing. Apple TrueTone display adjusts better than Android phones with changes in ambient light - software: iOS 11.2.5 is very user friendly and intuitive. My phone hasnt ever lagged or stuttered so far. - pretty good battery backup (easily lasting for an entire day on normal usage) - FaceID is a whole new ball game and apple wins it hands down. It is extremely accurate and easy to use and unlocks your phone as fast as fingerprint and even works in the dark. It is also secure as it checks if you are looking at the phone before performing a FaceID action. This is by far the best feature I felt on iPhone X and is a class apart from android phones. - the camera is really good in daylight and has a host of new features which includes portrait mode. Cons: - I personally dont like the notch at the top and makes the display look a little ugly. - Fast charger is not provided in the box. The charger provided takes very long (~1 hr 45 min) to charge the phone. - Earphones provided are not of the best quality. - Front camera is pretty average and doesnt take exceptional pictures under dim lighting conditions. That said, iPhone X is overpriced and is definitely not value for money. But if you are willing to shell off money to get the best phone in the market then this is what you should buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 10 February 2018"
"","","Veda Prakash Chinta","Well, let me start by saying this- iPhone X is a fantastic phone, easily beats every expectation, there has never been a hint of doubt about it. I have been Android user most of my life I started off with using HTC Wildfire, then - Galaxy S3, HTC One M7, Lumia 920 (Windows), Moto X Play and Galaxy S7. My wife has been using Android as well - HTC Wildfire, Galaxy Note 2, Oppo F7, now Nokia 8. So, I can say I pretty much used most of what Android has to offer, therefore, I wanted to get myself an iPhone. Initially, there was a lot of resistance from me to go for iPhone as I have heard from people that it is not that user friendly or has less functionality, more restrictive etc etc.... however, I wanted to try it strongly- so bought iPhone X. I will come out and say that it was not a fantastic move from Android, but more of a “change over” kind of move. iPhone isn’t as much better than Android as people say it is... however, it comes with its own bells and whistles. Screen- top notch, (Samsung had this from a while though), Camera - best in segment (better than Galaxy S9), Speaker - Fantastic, Apps- well, no issues here, Battery- did not expect this would last so long.. GREAT ENDURANCE. Now, iOS is not as loaded as Android, so, do not expect it to do all the stuff that Android does, but it is very smooth and fluidic. Never faced a jitter or frozen screen. It’s very secure, intuitive in its own way. The best part is- no nonsensical bloatware that eats up your storage. I saw Android needing “Factory reset” every couple of months to work smoothly- iOS does not need this- the one USP for me. So, if you have to take my advise, go for it if you have faced issues with Android else, no need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 19 September 2019"
"","","Ktron","Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k. Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine. iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an ""IN"" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!! Pros: 1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it 2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking 3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm’s chips has always been better than Intel’s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901. Cons: 1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage. So recommend having a case around it (preferably a transparent one so that the beauty of the original phone can still be enjoyed!) 2) I have to say that battery life is average - a shade better than iPhone 8. 3) Additional touch id support would have been better as an alternative unlocking option Will come up with a detailed review soon in a couple of weeks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 11 October 2018"
"","","The Honest Guy","I have recently ordered iPhone for my cousin and you can find below my review on the product based on a weeks usage. I will update this again after a month of use. Personally i have been a iPhone user for a long time now and yes i use Android phones also, because i am an app developer. iPhone X Pros - Size and design, iPhone X is an unbelievably designed device, that feels so sleek and handy. It is slightly larger than iPhone 8 but smaller than iPhone 8 S. I have attached images taken from Apple store for comparison. - Camera - It has the best ever camera on an iPhone. I said on iPhone, because there are devices like Pixel 2, Mi 8 , Huawei P20 Pro that comes with half the price of iPhone x and better camera. - Shooting videos - I have always noticed that iPhone offers an edge in video quality over other phones of similar specs - Waterproof - iPhone X is rated IP67. A lot of people lose their phones due to water damage. Sometimes, an iphone can save you from buying a new phone, which is a kind of cost saving. Especially if you spend a lot of time in pool, outdoor activities this might be a boon. Also you can shoot a lot of underground videos. Cons - Costly, yes iPhone X comes at a very premium price. It's a phone made for high class category only - If you are looking for best camera phone, go for something else. You can get a Pixel 2, Mi8 , or P20 for less than half price. These phones have better Dxomark scores than iPhoneX. Head on to Dxo Mark website and check. Being an iPhone user for a long time, i would also like to list a few cons and pros of using iPhone compared to Android iPhone Pros - If you have a mac, iPhone can work seamlessly with mac. The same apps are available for mac and iPhone which syncs seamlessly. Calendar, TODOs, Notes, Contacts etc helps me a lot. I add a todo from my mac and next moment i have it on my phone too. That works great. - If you are someone who is hooked up to mac always, you can easily attend your calls on mac ig both devices are on same network. I have found this really helpful - Apple makes the best non bud type earphones in my experience. Personally i do not like in ear canal earphones as they can impair hearing. I have found no other good alternatives to Apple earphones in terms of audio clarity. But yes you can get better over the ear or in canal earphones. - Physical button for silent mode - Yes, thats a quick and comfy shortcut to turn your phone silent even without unlocking it/turning screen on. If you are a person who attends a lot of meetings and requires to turn phone silent, this can be quite helpful. You can quickly check the button position and say your phone is silent or not. iPhone Cons -  Accessories are costly - If you need to buy an extra cable(maybe for office) or adapter, you need to shell somewhere between 1500 to 2500 bucks. Chinese accessories won't work well and perfect with iPhone - iOS is buggy at times. I have to admit that. Not just that, apple bug fixing is very slow compared to Googles Android -  Apple music is slighly costly comapred to Google music - 120 rs per month If you are looking for cheaper alternatives, i would suggest you the Google Pixel 2. Google pixel comes with Unlimited Original quality photo and video storage. On iPhone, for the same thing you have to shell out additional 75INR per month for 50 GB. For higher storage you need to pay more. If you are a person who shoots a lot of videos, Googles Unlimited storage can save you a lot of money. However you can install Google photos and get Unlimited Normal backup for photos and videos on any iOS/Android phone, where Google converts the files to reduce quality. For images, its quite ok, the difference is barely noticeable, but for videos yes , they convert it to One-fourth the size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 9 July 2018"
"","","Nabeel Ehtesham","The X might have the thinnest screen bezels of any iPhone, but it could only get there by ditching the physical home button. That also meant getting rid of TouchID fingerprint scanning, so instead we get FaceID facial recognition. It takes two cameras (one regular, one IR) an IR dot emitter and separate IR flood illuminator to accurately scan and recognise your face in less than half a second, and all that tech takes up space. The way it bulges out into the display is certainly unique. It’s a bit like Marmite - you either love the distinctive look, or you hate the way it intrudes on your screen space. After a week with the phone, I’m in the former camp - although the effect it has on software is another matter. Open an app that hasn’t been updated yet and you’ll get massive black borders at the top and bottom of the screen, or left and right when you’re in landscape. The notch is unmissable in this mode when you open Safari, with certain web pages looking downright ugly. Apps that use Apple’s autolayout fill the screen, but not always how you’d expect - sometimes blocking out the battery indicator or losing UI elements offscreen. Even apps that have been updated can look a little funky. The fact that big names like Spotify didn’t have updated apps ready to go on launch day is a bit of a joke. But anyway, back to the screen itself. It’s a 5.8in panel, technically making it larger than the iPhone 8 Plus, but the 19.5:9 aspect ratio means it’s more like an iPhone 8 stretched vertically. Add in the notch and that’s quite a lot of dead space in certain apps and games. Honestly, though? It’s difficult to mind that much - the screen is absolutely phenomenal. That’s mainly down to the switch from LCD to OLED, giving the X the impeccable contrast and deep, inky blacks that have been impressing us on Samsung’s Galaxy phones for years. Resolution has leapt up to 2436x1125, a big change from the iPhone 8 Plus and its 1080p panel. Pentile panel tech might not resolve as much detail as an RGB LCD screen, but some clever anti-aliasing on Apple’s part means it’s difficult to spot any lack of detail. OLED panels can end up so looking ridiculously vibrant you’ll want to wear sunglasses whenever you look at them, but Apple has been pretty restrained here: photos and videos on the X still pop with colour, but they stay on the right side of realistic. TrueTone colour calibration helps here, automatically tweaking the colour temperature to match the ambient light around you. It’s a subtle effect, but you’ll notice the difference when you flick it on and off in the settings screen. It gets impressively bright for an OLED panel, too. I had no problem reading the screen outdoors on a sunny day. That brightness comes in handy for HDR video - the X supports both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. Netflix is already updated, and works great on a good connection, with a great range of colour and more depth to dark scenes. For all the pitchforks and torches banging on Google’s door over the Pixel 2 XL’s off-angle colour shift, the iPhone X isn’t immune from the effects either. With no home button, the X makes you rethink how to use your iPhone. And it all starts with FaceID. Instead of tapping the fingerprint sensor, you now raise the phone, tap anywhere onscreen or press the side button to wake it, then swipe up from the bottom of the display to get past the lock screen. Normally, in the time you’ve done all that, FaceID has fired out thousands of tiny infra red dots, scanned them with an IR camera, and mapped your face. All your contours, curves, bumps and ridges make for a unique ID that’s even more difficult to fool than a fingerprint sensor. As you’ve only got one face (I hope), you don’t have to consider which hand you’ll be picking up the phone with, or to hold it in a certain way so your finger lines up with a physical button - handy if you found the iPhone 8 just a little bit too small, or the Plus that little bit too big. When FaceID works, it works brilliantly, taking less than half a second to recognise you and unlock the phone. Over time, it’ll get better at recognising you, tracking things like hair and beard growth so as not to get confused. Go for a shave and buzzcut and you might need to retrain it, though. It worked through sunglasses, while I was wearing chunky headphones, and with a hoodie covering my hair, but leaning my hand on my chin could sometimes defeat it. Lying in bed, I would often hold the phone too close to get a match, and it’s harder to unlock while sat on your desk than the old TouchID system. It might not be 100% accurate, but it’s still better than any other face scanner we’ve tried on a phone, including the ones found on some Samsungs. When it does fail, you’ve got to tap in a passcode - just like you would with TouchID. It’s not exactly elegant, but it’s rare enough not to be annoying - unless you’re stood at a London Underground ticket barrier, with a queue of people behind you. Double-tapping the side button to invoke Apple Pay and waiting for a face match feels a little bit slower than the old TouchID system, but maybe that’ll change once it becomes second nature. All these face-scanning shenanigans might sound serious, but there’s a lighter side to it all too. Fire up iMessage and you can play with Animoji: animated emoji characters that you can move with your face. By motion-tracking your facial features, the phone can animate your eyes and expressions perfectly, recording your voice in sync for sending as messages to your mates. It’s purely for fun, and all but guaranteed to annoy your non-iPhone X equipped mates, but undeniably cute at the same time. While the notch might seem like a big deal, it totally disappears once you’ve spent a few hours with the phone. With most day-to-day tasks, you won’t really notice it, especially when using the iPhone X in portrait mode. What you will notice over time is how the entire iOS UI has been redesigned around it. Until now, iPhone models have had an ever-present (unless you are in the full-screen mode) bar that’s been used to display all kinds of important information from the time, to signal strength, and to even indicate if some app is using your location information. With the iPhone X’s notch, there’s very little space for all this information - the left side is taken up entirely by the clock, while the right only has room for the signal strength indicator, 3G/ 4G/ Wi-Fi indicator, and the battery icon. You no longer see things like the name of the network, which might not seem like a big loss, but there are two other compromises that will potentially be more upsetting for most users. The battery percentage and Bluetooth connection status are now only visible only if you swipe down from the right of the notch, and there’s no way to have them always visible. If you use Bluetooth devices like AirPods, speakers, or in-car units, you can no longer tell at a glance if your phone is connected. The notch will bother you in full-screen games and videos, or if you use the your phone in landscape mode a lot. By default, the aspect ratio of the iPhone X’s display means that most videos will play with thick enough black bands on the left and right that the notch will blend in without any problems. However, if you choose to zoom in - by using pinch-to-zoom in the YouTube app for example - you bring the notch into play, even as the video gets cropped like on any other device. We regularly watched videos zoomed-in and it didn’t bother us one bit, but your mileage may vary. On the other hand, we did like some of the changes that the notch’s presence has resulted in. One of our favourite iOS features is the ability to scroll to the top of any list or page by tapping the bar at top. However, if some app is using your location in the background, or if some device is connected to the hotspot on your phone, this functionality breaks as tapping on the bar then takes you to the app using your location in the background, or the Hotspot settings, as the case may be. With the iPhone X, the location/ hotspot alerts are restricted to the left “ear”, which means you can still tap the notch or the right ear to scroll to the top of any list - that’s right, the notch does recognise your taps. We’ve spent considerable time talking about the notch, but if you are wondering what exactly it is, this little section is for you. With the iPhone X doing away with the Home button - and with it the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, Apple needed a new way for us to quickly and securely log in to our devices and authorise payments. The solution is Face ID, and the notch contains the front camera and 3D sensing sensors that make this technology possible. The three main components here are the infrared camera, flood illuminator, and dot projector. The latter projects “more than 30,000 invisible dots” onto your face to build a 3D map that can be used to identify you. The flood illuminator makes it possible to do that in the dark by emitting invisible infrared light, and the infrared camera reads the dot pattern. The infrared image is sent to the Secure Enclave in the A11 Bionic chip - a special area that’s used to store biometric data on the chip that powers the iPhone X - to confirm a match. Like with Touch ID, Apple says no biometric data actually leaves the device at any point, which means that your privacy is assured. The day the iPhone X was announced - and well before we had spent any meaningful time with it - we said that Face ID felt like a compromise, that it could never be as fast as Touch ID, and that Apple would go back to using fingerprint scanners as soon as it could figure out how to embed them into the glass fronts of its phones . A couple of months into having used the iPhone X, it’s safe to say that while Face ID might not have the raw speed of Touch ID, a move away from Face ID won’t be because of any significant drawbacks in the technology. It works seamlessly on most occasions, and more reliably than we’d imagined it would going into our review. It’s almost like having any no passcode or security feature on your device. That might not be a change for many people - despite manufacturers’ warnings during the setup process, we find an uncomfortably large number of people continue to use their smartphones without a passcode - but for everyone else, Face ID reduces the extra step of unlocking your phone before you can use it.Granted, most of us had become accustomed to using fingerprints to the point that it never felt like an “additional step”, but now, at most times, you can just pick up your iPhone X and trust that Face ID is just authenticating you in the background. For all practical purposes, this feels like using a phone without a passcode. This is especially great when you are interacting with notifications. Before the iPhone X, tapping on a notification - say, to read an email - on a locked device meant using Touch ID or needing to enter passcode to unlock before you could proceed. With Face ID, the additional step is removed, and you can now interact with notifications as originally intended The ‘notch’ is where all the Face ID bits are housed Face ID isn’t perfect, though, but then neither was Touch ID; the fingerprint scanner was poor if your fingers were slightly greasy or wet. This isn’t a problem now. However, I have found that Face ID struggles if my eyes are a shrivelled mess, usually first thing in the morning, and if the phone isn’t close enough to my face. If you’re the type of person who tries to sneak a look at their notifications with your phone at pocket-level then you’re out of luck. Apps that previously used Touch ID as a means of unlocking will automatically be replaced by Face ID without the need for an update, and you can of course use it for Apple Pay payments too. iPhone X – Screen The iPhone X sees Apple switch out its usual LCD screen tech for an OLED panel for the first time. Samsung, Google and many other Android phone makers have been using this technology for some time now, and it’s nice to see Apple finally joining the fray with a product other than the Apple Watch. This is also the highest-resolution screen ever on an iPhone, with a slightly odd 2436 x 1125 pixels, plus there’s support for the DCI P3 colour gamut and Dolby Vision HDR. OLEDs offer better contrast, true blacks and a more colourful picture, but they’re not always perfect. The LG panels used by Google in the Pixel 2 XL have come in for plenty of criticism for poor viewing angles and an odd blue tinge. Even the excellent screen on the Samsung Galaxy S8 is prone to suffering poor viewing angles. Apple’s OLEDs come from Samsung, and while there’s a small shift to blue if you tilt the device off-axis, it’s far less noticeable than on the Pixel 2 XL. Apple says it’s made a fair few tweaks to this panel, and the company’s optimisation of it is certainly different to Samsung’s approach for its own Galaxy S8 and Note 8 panels. Colours on the iPhone X are more natural and the saturation isn’t quite so intense. At last...... The Good A great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous OLED screen. Rear telephoto camera outshoots the 8 Plus in low light, and the front camera snaps impressive portrait selfies. Face ID generally works fine. The Bad New interface and no home button mean major adjustments, and key features such as the Control Center are harder to reach and use. It’ll take time for most apps to be optimized for notched screen. The phone is hella expensive, and the all-glass design means a case and an insurance plan are musts. Shorter battery life than iPhone Plus models. The Bottom Line iPhone X is an overdue and winning evolution of the iPhone, but you’ll need to leave your comfort zone to make a jump into the face-recognizing future.

I was sceptical while purchasing this product due to the high price but the performance does justify that. 2. Even after rigorous use, the mobile has withstood everything and till date performs quite brilliantly 3. The battery life is the only con I found with it. With time, the battery life truly reduces but you can replace your battery if it is very poor. 4. The camera is pretty decent now although you can’t compare it with the newer iPhones To sum it up, I don’t think anyone wants to purchase this model anymore because there are newer models available and it’d make sense to buy those instead but just to put my review out there, I can say it is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made without any regrets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 4 April 2022"
"","","Enkie","Since the day iPhone came out in 2007, I have used every other model starting from Original iphone, 3GS, 4, 5, 6, SE, and now the iPhone X, after the iPhone 6 (2016), i thought why not try out android, which i did in the most prestigious samsung Galaxy S7 which was a good change, but didn't quite liked it much, then came the much talked about one plus 3t, which was almost good (Better design all metal and probably sleeker) in comparison to the Samsung Flagship at the time (I am using MBP, iMac, Airport Extreme wireless connections to android are not seamless, neither do i have option of imessage, or taking up my phone calls on my laptop which is a big advantage of owning an IOS and a MAC OS device). I DID NOT HAD A NICE EXPERIENCE with android, so planned to move back to IOS, and at the time was skeptical on getting the iPhone 7 Plus, cause of the size, cause i like smaller phones, and knew how inconvenience it is to carry after OP3t so went for iPhone SE, which i still prefer to use over my iPhone X, it's just handy. Reachability i give you that, is a hindrance, but everyone is making phones bigger. Let phones be phones, you want bigger screen go buy ipads or other tablets, they offer excellent connectivity for sharing files. I know the whole point is to carry less on hand but, carrying something that barely fits your hand is also not convenient. My Experience with iPhone X, it's great, though it pinches to have spent this amount on a phone, but it just gets the job done, don't have to rely on unknown sources of softwares to connect to various things. People who have Apple products can understand this better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 2 January 2018"
"","","Tsering","The flagship phone from Apple is undoubtedly a marvel though the price tag was a big deterrent for me. Before finalizing, I compared it with Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and Google Pixel 2 - on almost all accounts I found iPhone X definitely more superior. My assessment after using it for 2 weeks is as follows: Pros 1. The Face ID is a first - a technological leap. It works most of the time except when the room is completely dark. 2. Speakers - This caught my attention immediately, the speakers on the bottom of the phone simply rock. 3. Screen - Is a little annoying initially but then Apple had to embed the facial recognition technology somewhere, you can live with it especially after you notice the brightness of the screen along with crystal clear display 4. Battery - Fairly decent, easily lasts a day with heavy usage of checking mails, surfing the net and video streaming. 5. Camera: The images are very impressive though Apple still has massive competition from Samsung here. 5. Looks - While there is nothing extraordinary, it does have a premium feel look and is heavy as compared to the earlier iPhone. A backcover ruins the feel of the phone but then it saves from potential damage it just in case if slips from your hand and falls on a hard/rough surface. Cons 1. The price but then everyone's buying without complaining so one can't do much. If you can afford it, close your eyes and buy it - simply worth it. Also for people who can't tolerate bloatware and restricted app privacy settings in Android, this phone has it all....","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 2 January 2018"

Now its been almost 1 month that i am using this (thanks amazon for the wonderful delivery and the seller Appario retail pvt ltd for building the trust) and trust me its worth every penny. I got an authentic product with earphones, charger and a connector, you can check it as well on imei24 and official apple website. It feels so premium in hands and very handy as compared to other latest phones. Yes i agree its very expensive but its worth it. I was a android user till now and i wanted a change so i decided for iphone X and i think i will be an apple user for life now lol. It will take you some time to explore the features as it is much different from Android but it's fun. Face recognition works like a charm and overall it is really fast so 3GB works same like the 8 GB RAM on the other phones.. Camera take the real and natural pictures with beautiful colors without fake filters and all. It is much more secure than the android phones. Battery backup might not be the best but its not that bad as well. Overall i would say its a great product and if you are bored from using andorid and need a change and also if you love luxury, Go for this.

Coming to the phone, I can truly justify the purchase at the price point I got it for and have no major issues whatsoever. I have been using iPhone 7 since two years and the screen is a big upgrade as compared to it, the size isn't that big and adds more than inch to Screen real estate. In real life usage, I didn't find the phone to lag anytime and feels fast, smooth and very responsive. The display is great as expected from an AMOLED and I noticed an increase in the battery life as well. iPhones typically, should be treated as an investment and not a product to show off. I am a power user and this serves all my needs very well. I am pretty sure that Apple will continue to support this product for quite a few years down the line as well therefore, went for the iPhone X instead of the iPhone XS.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 9 November 2018"

Face ID works most times only you need to get adjusted, the distance from hand to face must be a bit close. There are so small bits which you will love like when you get a notification SMS or what’s app message it will not show you the content only when u look at it you can see the content. Now you can wake up the phone with just a touch, Battery life lasts whole day for me Screen is amazing wish it was bigger To power off your phone you need to hold volume and the power key You will not miss the Touch ID after few days of use the swipe up works like a charm Now to close apps you need to swipe up and press and hold any app and then close Siri also has improved, now hey Siri works while charging. Finally don’t go by many fake reviews posted( I can’t understand why amazon allows posting of such reviews which have been posted only for fun), if you can afford it go for it. As apps are being updated for the X it’s getting better","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 6 December 2017"

I upgraded from. 6s 64 gig to iPhone X and must say it was a much needed switch.. This phone is undoubtedly the best in market as far as looks and performance goes.. the so called notch doesn’t at all come in the way and the OLED screen is just too perfect.. I don’t really think an iPhone needs a review, it’s as simple as use it to believe it! The only thing I didn’t like is that the price reduced by 4.5k during new year immediately  after I purchased, but that’s a gamble one has to play! I won’t even say it’s overpriced as it’s obvious that iPhone is an iPhone. It has excellent resale value and if at all I want to sell it after 2 years I think I can get a good value.. of course you need to protect your phone with a good case..

The camera is great for daylight images , but there are phones at a much economical price with better lowlight cameras .

On another phone everything was fine except the glass edges feel rough and the glass is a little bit outwords also. If we are paying such a high amount for these phones then they should not have these kinds of problems. Now amazon is not providing me with an option to get replacement but instead I have to go at apple service centre and submit my phone with them for 3-4 days. Until then no phone or a standby phone from apple. This is a very poor experience as I will have to go through all the hassle. Other than that the delivery was on time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 10 October 2018"

Truecaller could not intercept calls to provide caller id 3. No native support for call recording 4. Deleting individual messages (SMS) is a hassle. Wish they could've provided same mechanism like delete conversation or other messages i.e. left swipe 5. Could not clear all notifications in one go. Right cross button to clear all appears after a while 6. Waiting for official wireless charger as could not find reliable reviews for other brand chargers I'm using Mac for around 4 years now and there is no software glitch I've observed. The purpose of getting iPhone was to get similar reliable OS and software performance which might take some time for Android to catch up and I'm highly satisfied till now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018"

Top most superior build quality. Stainless steel is simple luxury.  Non ios users will also feel the premiumness just on seeing this and holding it. Face id is better than touch id in terms of usability. Literally no one can sneak into ur phone if u know how to use face id properly. Only thing that slightly lets is down is battery life. It goes for around a day easily but don’t expect anything more from the battery.  All in all simply the best phone ever.

The camera is top notch and portrait mode is the best any camera offers. There are so many inbuilt AR apps which take the game to the outer space. The battery life is quite good as well. With heavy use it’s been able to last more than 12-14 hours. No heating issues. Supports siri and amazon alexa as well out of the box. Though it is a very slippery phone so first don’t forget to get a heavy phone cover. Only if you use you will realise why this phone is expensive and as always nothing comes closer to apples interface.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 30 December 2018"

Apple told me to get a replacement since Amazon is not their authorized seller, it will be handled on amazon's side. Update: Amazon sent an inspection Unprofessional and looks like he wasn't even qualified. I can see the defect clearly, but he is being adamant, that it's supposed to be like that? When I asked if the back panel of iPhone X is steel or glass, he was stammering, and only after looking realized that the back is glass panel. Underqualified and unprofessional inspection, taking pictures of the phone which was not even focused, so basically taking a blurry photo on an inspection, speaks volume about his capabilities.

What not good about it is the cost to maintain the phone. So I did not buy the insurance thinking that I will manage the repairs without getting an insurance. But one fine day I dropped the iPhone X and the back glass of the phone was damaged. So I went to Apple Care to replace it since its looking shabby. To my surprise, I got to know that the BACK GLASS is not replaceable and that to solve this issue you will have to replace the whole phone which will cost Rs.54000 which does not make sense. So one thing is clear that replacing parts are damn expensive and you should buy an Apple protection plan which will cover your phone from liquid and phone damage which you can buy for merely Rs. 8000.

After speaking with Apple customer care for over 2 hours I am yet to receive a solution which may take 2-3 days! But come on!!! It's the basic function of a phone! My worst purchase ever! Also if you still have to waste your money on this ""premium product"" then most definitely don't buy online through Amazon cause they provide zero support. They have a 10day return policy and your phone stops working on 14th day and you are abandoned and left on your own to deal with apple. Who btw don't replace your phone and instead do some ""investigation"" and take their own sweet time. And did I mention the problem is the basic feature of any phone!!!!.... Unable to hear anything on calls!!!! And it doesn't matter what your review or feedback or your experience is .. both Apple and Amazon care more about their ""profit-making policies"" rather than the customer's experience or problems. You can rest assured that your issues and feedback is just background noise to them. What's worse is that this was my gift to my mum. And it turned out to be an utter flop.

But the day I received the order was epic. The phone is simply superb. Everything about the phone is perfect....hey what do expect from an Apple product. Good battery life, durable with screen protector and case and screen quality is excellent. Thank you Amazon","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 12 November 2018"
"","","venkat","Was skeptical to buy, but googled and found Appario Retail is Patni group company and Amazon has investments. Thanks to SBI and Appario Retail, Amazon for the good price offer. I got instant discount of 2000 and Amazon Pay cashback of 1000, awaiting for SBI cashback of 6000, then finally it will be 71K. The best part is free EMI but I haven't availed it though. Specs and usability no need to review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 18 October 2018"
"","","Arshdeep Singh","Its been 18days since i am using iphone x and its amazing.To be honest i was little scary ordering this phone online but the deal is something that i cant miss. Phone is working quite decent and i can suggest anyone to buy it from amazon. There is nothing like you will get defective piece, a clone or a soap 😂😂. Thanks to Amazon for giving me iphone x at unbeatable price","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 1 November 2018"
"","","Vishal","If u dont have any grudge against apple (many android lovers do) U will find it to be the best phone to use irrespective of software it is the best phone to experience period (now xs ). Using it daily really ive realised how much easier and premium it feels compared to android.its just easier and makes sense if u can afford it","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 8 May 2019"
"","","Amey","Ordered this with Apple’s genuine 12W charging adapter, the 5W which comes is extremely slow and takes ages to charge. If’s it’s worth for this price tag is still debatable, I’ve been using iPhones since iPhone 6 days and im completely into Apple’s eco system, have almost every Apple Product so price don’t really matter for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 24 April 2018"
"","","Akash Mishra","Within the usage of the first few days, developed a big scratch on the screen. Now have a screen guard placed and a silicone cover for the protection. Apple X performance is as expected. Battery life should be much better for a phone with this price band.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 7 December 2018"
"","","Gaurav Gautam","This phone is lit. I gifted it to my sister cause i am not huge on iOS but this one certainly impressed me. After just 20 minutes of exposure i learnt all the gestures and found myself doing them on my V20. Its expensive yes but it feels like it was meant for those price tag. Well done Apple. PS I didn't like the front camera. Everything else is impressive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 9 November 2018"
"","","Azhar Hussain","My 4th Iphone - 4, 5 & 6s before iPhone X. Tried android post 6S. never will try android again. Got the best deal in Oct 2018. Net price of 63k with all discounts(no exchange of any phone, purely card discounts). Never disappointed with iPhone. Only drawback is battery backup(big upgrade from previous models but could be better in comparison) & charging speed","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 5 March 2019"
"","","Amazon Customer","Delivery was very fast with prime. Being a iPhone user since 2008 I expected this phone to have X factor but phone gets hot with  even slightly above normal usage. Phone doesn’t Worth 80+ k . Face recognition is not at par with finger print sensor.But if you need class then it’s the only option","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 26 April 2018"
"","","Asif Ali","This is iPhone X. No doubt I’ll ever give it less than 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. I would strongly recommend you to make a video of opening the box when your receive it like I did. It would give you proof if your product is perfect or damaged. I did the same and it turned out to be perfect for me. I don’t know about others. As far as I know amazon provide 10-15 days return policy on Apple iPhone X.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 25 February 2018"
"","","Ansh","It’s a little heavy but the pros outweigh the cons by a distance. Durability, water resistance, readability and less stress in eyes due to True Tone, amazing screen space and touch feel, no buttons all gestures and the login by looking into the device is just amazing. There’s a lot more to say but as of now the price i will say is worth the moolah and I’m more than impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in India on 4 June 2018"
